# SchreckNet

SchreckNet is a fork of [Cockatrice](https://cockatrice.github.io/) to play Vampire: The Eternal Struggle online.
It serves as a modern replacement for LackyCCG.
The program's server design prevents users from manipulating the game for unfair advantage. The client also provides a single-player mode, which allows users to brew while offline. This project uses C++ and the Qt6 libraries.<br> The Parthenon is used to upgrade the card database. <br>
